- Hello! I am a new developer with a huge passion with Game Dev,
- I am learning C#, self-teaching and actually trying to improve my skills!
- I am also using Godot 4 for my projects and experience (so far it is slow...)
- I am also a hobbyist and I also do art, writing, and eventually doing code! out though I don't have music making experience.
- I also would love to get help incase I do get stuck!
